  <section><p>Before reading Stanley&rsquo;s book, I would have assumed that early modern Japan had hyper-low divorce rates, or perhaps even lacked a legal mechanism for divorce. Even today, Japan has a <a href="https://www.datapandas.org/ranking/divorce-rates-by-country#full-data">relatively low divorce rate</a>—1.7 per thousand people, compared with 2.7 in the US and 3.2 in China—and you might figure it was even lower during the Tokugawa era. But on the contrary, divorce was actually quite common.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although every girl could expect to marry, everyone knew that marriages didn’t necessarily last. By some counts, nearly half of women ended up divorced from their first husbands. Divorce was a practical solution, a safety valve for a family system where so much depended on the compatibility of young couples. Newly married people usually lived with their in-laws, and the success of the new household relied on the labor and goodwill of the new wife (or, sometimes, husband) who had joined the family. If the bride or groom was found lacking in some fundamental way, then it was best to call off the marriage and try again. <label for="sidenote-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">(1)</label>

<p>This was quite surprising to me. It turns out that patriarchal societies with strong family values can not ony accomodate sky-high divorce rates, but might actually require them in order to remain stable.</p>
