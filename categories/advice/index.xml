      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing a nametag out in public (as often as I can remember to put it on) for the last three months, and I think you should consider doing the same. ⊕ Your nametag doesn’t have to be fancy. As you can see, mine isn’t. Why? # Remind acquaintances of your name. I have upwards of a hundred acquaintances I can recognize on sight and whom I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to at least once whose names I cannot recall.</description>
