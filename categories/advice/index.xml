      <description>Motivation # You are awash in numbers. You read them in news articles, hear them in conversations, ponder over them in textbooks. The half-life of carbon 14 is 5700 years. The cruising speed of a Boeing 747 is 900 kilometers per hour. The diameter of a Covid-19 particle is 80 nanometers. Your response to this torrent of numbers could be to let it flow past without leaving much impression on your brain.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing a nametag out in public (as often as I can remember to put it on) for the last three months, and I think you should consider doing the same. ⊕ Your nametag doesn’t have to be fancy. As you can see, mine isn’t. Why? # Remind acquaintances of your name. I have upwards of a hundred acquaintances I can recognize on sight and whom I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to at least once whose names I cannot recall.</description>
