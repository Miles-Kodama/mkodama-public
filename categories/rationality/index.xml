      <description>Main points # I take this book to be mainly about the expected value (EV) principle, which says that when you make a decision under risk, you should maximize your probability weighted average payoff. The concept of expected value makes only a brief appearance in one chapter, and you won&amp;rsquo;t find a mathematical formula for it anywhere in the book. But as Taleb says, “mathematics is a tool to meditate, not compute,” and most of what he writes in Fooled by Randomness is implicitly a meditation on EV.</description>
