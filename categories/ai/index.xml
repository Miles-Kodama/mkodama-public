      <description>I originally wrote this post for an essay contest at my school. It won the third place prize and was published in a campus magazine under a slightly different title. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that my discussion is rather parochial in its focus on Williams, but my main claims easily generalize to other institutions. As always, I invite comments, objections, and feedback.&#xA;Williams is due for a deep rethink on the role of artificial intelligence (hereafter AI) in college classes.</description>
