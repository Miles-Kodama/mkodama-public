They&#39;re notorious for fighting in the Russo-Ukrainian War and the Syrian Civil War, among other conflicts. They also came very close to overthrowing the Putin regime in summer 2023. Wagner&#39;s leader Yevgeny Prigozhin all but declared war on Moscow in a social media video, then marched his troops from the front to within 200 miles of the capital. But then the rebellion evaporated, apparently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/27/europe/lukashenko-wagner-rebellion-negotiations-putin-intl">thanks to a settlement</a> brokered by Alexandr Lukashenko. Prigozhin went into exile in Belarus for about two months before being killed in a plane crash. Wagner troops were reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/wagner-forces-not-engaged-ukraine-any-significant-way-pentagon-2023-07-13/">pulled out of Ukraine</a>. It seemed like the end of the road for Wagner, except that two years later they&#39;re still somehow <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2025/08/27/putins-botched-african-adventure">causing trouble</a> in Mali.</p> <p>I&#39;m interested in the Wagner Group&#39;s history because of what it says both about modern Russia and about dictatorships in general. What kind of state allows a loose cannon like Prighozin to mass a 50 thousand-strong private army and then fails to infiltrate it with state security?<sup id="fnref:infiltration"><a href="#fndef:infiltration" class=fnref >[2]</a></sup> Why was the Putin regime so catastrophically unprepared for the Wagner revolt? All of this clashes with my models of Russia and Putin. Isn&#39;t all of Russia under extremely tight state control and constant surveillance? How did Putin, so famously paranoid, not do more to stop Wagner from revolting in the first place?</p> <p>I also have questions about how the revolt ended. Could Prigozhin really have believed that the terms of the deal would be honored and he would get to live? It&#39;s hard to believe he could have been so naïve, especially since the day after Wagner stood down, <a href="https://manifold.markets/BTE/will-yevgeny-prigozhin-be-killed-du">prediction markets</a> gave him a <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant=normal >/</mi><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/3</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class=mord >1/3</span></span></span></span> chance of being killed within the year. So there must have been more to the Wagner-Putin deal than was publicly announced, right? <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/06/25/yevgeny-prigozhin-moscow-advance-putin-threat-wagner-family/"><em>The Telegraph</em> claimed</a> that Wagner really backed down because some of their leaders&#39; families were in state custody and Putin threatened to tortue them, but no independent sources have confirmed this story. Is it true?</p> <p>What does this whole episode teach us about the game theory of powergrabs? At the time that Prighozin declared his revolt,<a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/06/what-game-theory-predicts.html">Tyler Cowen predicted</a> that he or Putin had to die within a week; there was no other stable equilibrium. In the event, it took more than a week, but I do think the spirit of Cowen&#39;s prediction was right. When <em>is</em> another stable equilibrium possible? In other words, when can you back down from a coup peacefully and survive? It seems like it would be in rulers&#39; own interest &#40;at least on some margins&#41; to create more credible off-ramps for rebels so that they don&#39;t fight to the death.<sup id="fnref:SunTzu"><a href="#fndef:SunTzu" class=fnref >[3]</a></sup></p> <p>The best author to write this book should be a Russophone, an experienced Putin watcher, and a competent investigative journalist. They should at least consult a scholar of coups and maybe they&#39;d even be one. A hypothetical sum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Without_a_Face:_The_Unlikely_Rise_of_Vladimir_Putin">Masha Gessen</a> and <a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/10989/seizing-power">Naunihal Singh</a> would be well qualified to write the book that I&#39;m looking for. </p> <h2 id=a_history_of_genomic_progress ><a href="#a_history_of_genomic_progress" class=header-anchor >A history of genomic progress</a></h2> <p>There&#39;s an epic story waiting to be told about how this happened.<sup id="fnref:CostCurve"><a href="#fndef:CostCurve" class=fnref >[4]</a></sup></p> <p><br/> <img src="/assets/images/Human_Genome_Cost_Curve.png" alt="Human genome cost curve" /></p> <p>In twenty years, we cut the cost of sequencing a human genome by more than five orders of magnitude&#33; And this feat is even more impressive if you look farther back in time. The first nucleic acid ever sequenced &#40;by <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.147.3664.1462">Robert Holley and others</a> in 1965&#41; was 76 nucleotides long and took 15 person-years to sequence. So if you had sequenced a full human genome in 1965 using Holley&#39;s methods, the labor cost alone would have been about 10 teradollars.<sup id="fnref:1965Cost"><a href="#fndef:1965Cost" class=fnref >[5]</a></sup> </p> <p>Some authors have already tried to tell the story of how sequencing costs plummetted. For instance, Jay Shendure and others have a nice paper called &quot;<a href="https://krishna.gs.washington.edu/">DNA sequencing at 40</a>,&quot; where they recount the history of DNA sequencing technologies from the seventies to 2017. James Heather and Benjamin Chain&#39;s &quot;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4727787/">The sequence of sequencers</a>&quot; covers roughly the same scope at a more comfortable pace. These papers are both pretty good, but I have three major complaints about them. &#40;1&#41; They&#39;re written for specialists. Unglossed biology jargon is everywhere, and when new sequencing methods are introduced, the authors don&#39;t do much to help readers picture what&#39;s happening physically. &#40;2&#41;&nbsp;They&#39;re out of date. Shendure &amp; al.&#39;s history of sequencing—the most recent high quality paper I could find—is eight years old, so it can&#39;t discuss important recent advances in paleogenomics, single-cell genomics, and probably other subfields of genomics I&#39;m not aware of. &#40;3&#41; Neither paper presents a unified thesis on how sequencing got cheap. Instead, they give us a mosaic of incremental innovations and leave us to figure out how they all added up to ten OOMs of progress. </p> <p>I see an opening here for someone to write <em>the</em> history of genomic progress. It should be sophisticated but accessible to non-experts with only college freshman level science knowledge. It should cover all the key innovations in nucleic acid sequencing technology up to 2025 and explain them on a physical level. And it should have one foot in economics so that it can answer the big question: How did sequencing get so cheap? Sarah Constantin has already taken an admirable swing at this one in her essay on &quot;<a href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/the-enchippening">The Enchippening</a>.&quot; She argues that sequencing got cheap by riding semiconductor manufacturing&#39;s coattails. The flow cells and photodetectors that make up the core of a modern DNA sequencer are made with the same methods we use to make computer chips, so as those methods have gotten <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore&#39;s_law">exponentially better</a>, sequencing has naturally gotten exponentially cheaper. I want to know how well this story holds up when you take a close look at the history of sequencing. When exactly did we start to enchipen sequencing, and was there really a dramatic change in the rate of progress at that point? What are the most important drivers of genomic progress besides the enchippening?</p> <p>This book calls for a special author. They must be enough of a scientist to <em>really</em> understand how sequencing works &#40;and has worked&#41;, but they also need some of the skills of an economist and a historian. The ideal author might be <a href="https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/">Saloni Dattani</a>, <a href="https://jsomers.net/">James Somers</a>, or some obscure guy living in Cambridge, Massachusetts who&#39;s seen the whole history of genomics firsthand and knows the field inside and out.</p> <h2 id=bonus_books_that_could_use_some_midwifery ><a href="#bonus_books_that_could_use_some_midwifery" class=header-anchor >Bonus: Books that could use some midwifery</a></h2> <p>Here are some books that are already partially written but could use some help coming into the world. If you&#39;re in a position to help get them finished and published, I urge you to do so. </p> <p>Caspar Hare has <a href="https://web.mit.edu/casparh/www/">announced</a> that he has a book under contract &quot;about whether big theories in physics, cosmology and metaphysics have a bearing on what we ought to believe about ordinary, common-or-garden things, and on what we ought to do in ordinary, common-or-garden contexts. I say they do.&quot; What an interesting and important thesis. As someone above the 99th percentile in time spent thinking about big theories in physics, cosmology, and metaphysics, I have awaited this book eagerly. But more than five years have passed since Hare first announced it, and there is still no book. <a href="https://substack.com/@bigifftrue/note/c-141505277?r&#61;1w1t8x">Rumor says</a> it may never be published.</p> <blockquote> <p>Bentham&#39;s Bulldog: I think sometimes facts that we might change our mind about should affect what we think about things. <br/> Daniel Muñoz: Caspar Hare has written a brilliant defense of this view in his masterpiece, Living in a Strange World. Unfortunately, the world will never read it, because Caspar is too lazy to write the blurb for the back cover.</p> </blockquote> <p>Anders Sandberg is working on a massively learned book about what a technologically mature civilization could achieve within our universe&#39;s ultimate limits. It&#39;s called <em>Grand Futures</em>. Sandberg has previewed the book&#39;s ideas in a <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/anders-sandberg-best-things-possible-in-our-universe/">lengthy interview</a> with Rob Wiblin, and it has a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2670036848">glowing review</a> from the not easily impressed Gavin Leech. I&#39;ve read a manuscript of <em>Grand Futures</em> from 2022, and I can confirm it lives up to the hype. Now I want Sandberg to finish the many TODOs that tease readers of his manuscript and get the great work published so it can be read and discussed more widely.</p> <p><a href="https://www.richard-moran.com/">Richard Moran</a>, maker lucid of authors abstruse, says he&#39;s writing a book on Marcel Proust.
